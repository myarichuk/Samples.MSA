# Samples.MSA
## The what and the why
A friend of mine was having trouble finding simple but working example of microservices that he could actually tinker with, finding instead either theoretical articles with lots of corporate bullshit or just weird samples in weird languages. I decided to prepare a simple example so it can be understood in short amount of time.

For a breakdown of what happens here, you can take a look at [this blog post](http://www.graymatterdeveloper.com/2019/11/28/hello-world-microservices/)

## Getting and running the project
* Compiling and running it would require [.Net Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
* Running the project depends on local installation of **RabbitMq**. You can get its installers from [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
